# Hi there! 👋
My name is Dawid. I am a final year student of Economic and Financial Analytics and a participant in the UEK Honours (WISE) program (link: https://cjk.uek.krakow.pl/o-uek-honours/).

My main interests lie in data analysis and data science, which is the field I want to pursue professionally. I primarily code in Python and feel most comfortable using this language. I have gained knowledge in this field through both my analytical studies and ongoing self-directed learning.

On my GitHub profile, you will find projects related to data analysis, which I undertake both as part of my studies and personal interests. Feel free to browse through them.

### Skills and Tools:
- Python,
- Jupyter Notebook,
- Git (GitHub).
